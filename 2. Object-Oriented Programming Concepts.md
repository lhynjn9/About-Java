# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

- Object

  - A software bundle of related state and behavior.

  - They all have *state*(fields) and *behavior(methods)*.

  - Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits.
    - Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
    - Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
    - Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
    - Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace *it*, not the entire machine.

- Class
  - A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
  - Class가 먼저인가 Object가 먼저인가에 대한 것은 확실치 않음


- Inheritance
  - Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
  -  each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of *subclasses*
  - use the `extends` keyword

- Interface
  - An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world.
    - this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler.
  - use the `implements` keyword
- Package
  - A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.
